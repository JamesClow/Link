# Link

Link is an experimental website I developed in **PHP** to help rock climbers connect with one another.

##About 

The site functions similarly to a modern dating website. 
Climbers are be matched based on their interests, ability, personality and climbing ethics. 
However unlike a traditional dating websites, this site is intended to be very casual and connect as many people as possible, regardless of gender.
